# Humwin & Darbold

<img src="svg/screenshot-400x250.jpg" alt="Screenshot"/>

For [js13kGames][js13kgames] 2021.
The theme was "Space".

Humwin, your friendly space exploring robot, is in search for his pal
Darbold, who has gone missing on a strange planet. What happened to him
and where is he?

Play the original submission [here][play].

Unfortunately, the game turned out to be too unforgiving and I failed to
make the solution clear. So here's a slightly improved [post-compo][post]
version.

Works on your phone, too.

## Build Requirements
